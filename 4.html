    <h1>RAID LEVEL 4: RAID Level 4 | JetStor RAID 4 Storage Systems</h1>
    <p>Each entire block is written onto a data disk. Parity for same rank blocks is generated on Writes, recorded on the parity disk and checked on Reads.

        RAID Level 4 storage systems require a minimum of 3 drives to implement.</p>

    <h3>This level uses large stripes, which means a user can read records from any single drive. Overlapped I/O can then be used for read operations. Because all write operations are required to update the parity drive, no I/O overlapping is possible.</h3>
    <h2>Characteristics and Advantages</h2>
        <em><ul>
            <li>Very high Read data transaction rate</li>
            <li>Low ratio of ECC (Parity) disks to data disks means high efficiency</li>
            <li>High aggregate Read transfer rate</li>
        </ul></em>
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <em><ul>
        <li>Quite complex controller design</li>
        <li>Worst Write transaction rate and Write aggregate transfer rate</li>
        <li>Difficult and inefficient data rebuild in the event of disk failure</li>
        <li>Block Read transfer rate equal to that of a single disk</li>
    </ul></em>
