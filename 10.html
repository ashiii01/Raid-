    <h3>Combining RAID 1 and RAID 0, this level is often referred to as RAID 10, which offers higher performance than RAID 1, but at a much higher cost. In RAID 1+0, the data is mirrored and the mirrors are striped.</h3>
    <h2>Characteristics and Advantages</h2>
        <em><ul>
            <li>RAID 10 is implemented as a striped array whose segments are RAID 1 arrays</li>
            <li>RAID 10 has the same fault tolerance as RAID level 1</li>
            <li>RAID 10 has the same overhead for fault-tolerance as mirroring alone</li>
            <li>High I/O rates are achieved by striping RAID 1 segments</li>
            <li>Under certain circumstances, RAID 10 array can sustain multiple simultaneous drive failures</li>
            <li>Excellent solution for sites that would have otherwise gone with RAID 1 but need some additional performance boost</li>
        </ul></em>
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <em><ul>
        <li>RAID level 10 can be very expensive / High overhead</li>
        <li>All drives must move in parallel to proper track lowering sustained performance</li>
        <li>Very limited scalability at a very high inherent cost</li>
     </ul></em>
     <h2>Recommended Applications</h2>
    <em><ul>
        <li>Database server requiring high performance and fault tolerance</li>
    </ul></em>
