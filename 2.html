    <h1>RAID LEVEL 2: RAID Level 2 | JetStor RAID 2 Storage Devices</h1>
    <p>Each bit of data word is written to a data disk drive (4 in this example: 0 to 3). Each data word has its Hamming Code ECC word recorded on the ECC disks. On Read, the ECC code verifies correct data or corrects single disk errors.</p>

    <h3>This configuration uses striping across disks, with some disks storing error checking and correcting (ECC) information. RAID 2 also uses a dedicated Hamming code parity, a linear form of ECC. RAID 2 has no advantage over RAID 3 and is no longer used.</h3>
    <h2>Characteristics and Advantages</h2>
        <em><ul>
            <li>"On the fly" data error correction</li>
            <li>Extremely high data transfer rates possible</li>
            <li>The higher the data transfer rate required, the better the ratio of data disks to ECC disks</li>
            <li>Relatively simple controller design compared to RAID levels 3,4 & 5</li>
        </ul></em>
    <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
    <em><ul>
        <li>Very high ratio of ECC disks to data disks with smaller word sizes - inefficient</li>
        <li>Entry level cost very high - requires very high transfer rate requirement to justify</li>
        <li>Transaction rate is equal to that of a single disk at best (with spindle synchronization)</li>
        <li>No commercial implementations exist / not commercially viable</li>
    </ul></em>
